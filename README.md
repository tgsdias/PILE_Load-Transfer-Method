# PILE_Load-Transfer-Method

The objective here is to model the mechanism of axial load distribution in piles under loading and unloading. To achieve this, the traditional load-transfer method is modified in two aspects:
1. A distinct unloading path is defined for the load-transfer functions
1. The displacement variable is modified to consider the effects of passive soil displacements
